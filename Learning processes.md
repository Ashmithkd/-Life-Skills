The best way to understand any topic is to explain it to someone else in an easy way.
For me the story of Barbara Oakley,the author was the most inspiring- the way she completly changed her career to the field she hated is really impressive
In active state we try to focus on what we are trying to learn whereas in the diffused state, we tend to relax and try to take our mind away from the topic which somehow helps us in solving our problems
Break down the topic in different parts- do the most important parts first and try to give atleast 20 hours in the process.
Going forward, i will definately apply the 20 hour rule, as i think by spending 20 hours on a topic, we get pass the initial phase where we would normally leave the skill we were trying to learn
