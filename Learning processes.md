- The best way to understand any topic is to explain it to someone else in an easy way.

- For me, the story of Barbara Oakley, the author, was the most inspiring - the way she completely changed her career to the field she hated is really impressive.

- In the active state, we try to focus on what we are trying to learn, whereas in the diffused state, we tend to relax and try to take our mind away from the topic, which somehow helps us in solving our problems.

- Break down the topic into different parts - do the most important parts first and try to give at least 20 hours in the process.

- Going forward, I will definitely apply the 20-hour rule, as I think that by spending 20 hours on a topic, we get past the initial phase where we would normally leave the skill we were trying to learn.
